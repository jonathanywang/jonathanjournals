                        <p class="p1">
                            I want to start off with a verse I came across recently that really made me step back and reflect:
                        </p>
                        <p class="verse">"Rend your heart and not your garments. Return to the Lord your God, for he is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in love, and he relents from sending calamity." Joel 2:13 (NIV)</p>
                        <p class="p2">
                            After reading this this verse, I realized I needed to step back and reflect. I need to surrender my heart and mind to the Lord. Despite my previous journal, I realized that my heart is heavy and I am really depending on my own self. I need to put my faith in the Lord. Recently, I've not been my best self and I've kind of pushed all my emotions down. I'm good at hiding my thoughts, and maybe it isn't for the best. Recently, I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed. I'm constantly tired and I don't even think my classes are that bad. I try to take care of my health but I don't feel it is working well. I need to trust God.
                        </p>

                        <p class="p2">I haven't been doing my devotionals lately. I'm constantly fatigued and tired, which doesn't work well with my devotionals because I usually do them at night. I think I need to create a goal for myself: that is to start taking time out of my day to spend with God, even if it is for a couple of minutes. I feel that my faith isn't at the point it was at first semester. In Galatians, Paul talks about how the Laws of Moses no longer apply in order to obtain salvation. Rather than works, it is faith that brings us salvation. Today in Tuesday small group, we were talking about the importance of faith. I think I need to ground myself more in my faith by spending more time with the Lord.</p>

                        <p class="p2">On another note, I am rather stressed about my future. Everyone around me seems to be working towards their future careers and goals through clubs and internships. I know that my future is in God's hands and I need to trust in Him, but seeing everyone else taking action and getting ahead gives me FOMO. For example, I want to do research and project teams, but I never brought myself to do them and now it is a bit too late. I am scared about the future. I am scared about what I am missing out on. I am scared.</p>

                        <p class="p3">I don't know anymore. Time flies by too fast. It feels so...monotonous. I wish I could stop time. I wish I could take a deep breath. I wish I could look around. I wish I could not worry. Sometimes, I wonder why I came to Cornell, other times I am grateful. Every day, I wake up, brush my teeth, do skincare, pack my bag, walk to class, eat lunch, walk to class again, go gymming, walk to the library, do work, go home, sleep. I don't know anymore. This may be an odd journal entry, but I really do need to reflect more. I'm glad you're here with me, reading about my thoughts and experiencing my life with me. :D</p>
