                        <p class="p1">On January 1, 2024, my family and I traveled to Rockport, Massachusetts for a family trip. This is the very first trip I have gone on in the year 2024. This was a way for us to celebrate the New Year and get together to have fun.</p>

                        <p class="p2">It was a Monday. January 1st that is. I can't believe it is already 2024. I am 18 years old and already in college. Time really does fly by fast. On this morning, I woke up at around 9 AM to the sound of my parents getting ready for the day ahead. Tired as I had probably slept at 3 AM the night before, I stumbled out of bed half asleep. I made my way to the bathroom, took off my retainers, brushed my teeth, and took a morning shower. I've started taking these recently ever since college started and I have no idea why. Coming out of the shower, I put on a green/black fleece quarter-zip I bought at Khols only the week before. I also put on some jeans I've been wearing for a couple days now. I don't know how long I should be wearing jeans before I wash them because I've only recently started wearing them. At 10:30, I grabbed my water bottle and rushed downstairs to fill up on the breakfast my mom made. I think it was eggs, baozi, and dumplings, but I've already forgot. My brothers did the same and we quickly piled into the car soon after, ready for what awaited.</p>
