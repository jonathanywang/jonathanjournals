                        <p class="p1">My name is Jonathan Wang and I am currently a freshman in college. I attend Cornell University and I am majoring in Computer Science in the College of Arts and Sciences. I am interested in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Robotics, and Web Design/Development. I also have an interest in Environmental Sustainability, leaving me with a desire to utilize computer science as a means to help the world.</p>

                        <p class="p2">I am 18 years old and my birthday is on July 16, 2005. I have a twin, Christopher, and an older brother, Alex. Christopher attends the University of Massachusetts Amherst and studies Biomedical Engineering. Alex attends Cornell University and studies Computer Science. We can be a hectic bunch sometimes... :/</p>

                        <p class="p3">Outside of academics, I have picked up a couple of hobbies. They include playing video games, exploring new cuisines, working out, fashion, dancing, and listening to music. I enjoy playing Valorant with friends, eating foods from different cultures with my family, and listening to Christian pop or Lofi. My dream is to travel the world, to glance up at the Northern Lights or look around in the middle of the Colosseum. I hope I can experience and explore the glory and beauty of God's creation.</p>

                        <h1><p class=p1>Growing Up</p></h1>
                        <p class="p1">I grew up an hour away from Boston. I've started saying this ever since I've went off to college because no one knows the town I really grew up in. I grew up in a small town called Northborough. It is bordered by several other -borough towns: Southborough, Westborough, and Marlborough. Ironically, Southborough is east of Northborough and Westborough is south of Northborough.</p>

                        <p class="p2">My childhood memories have blurred as I've gotten older, but there are some distinct ones that I can still recall. From the time I was born, my grandparents on my dad's side have lived with us. We would always celebrate holidays and birthdays with them, sometimes with my cousins as well. From preschool to middle school, whenever school was over, my brothers and I would rush to the living room and watch TV. Curious George was always a hit. My parents put us through Kumon to get us to learn ahead in both mathematics and reading. Being the mischevious kid I was, I did anything to get out of doing the homework I was assigned. However, now I realize the true impact Kumon had on my future. My parents had a rule: we could only play videogames once we finished our Kumon and school homework. One IPad turned into three as we each wanted to play Minecraft. Minecraft was THE game of my childhood. But in all, I am so grateful for my parents, who invested in my childhood, teaching me how to walk, bike, put me through piano lessons, and supported me every step of the way. My childhood was like any other childhood, but I would never trade it away for another.</p>

                        <p class="p3">If you've never met me in person or did not know me prior to college, you may not know that I was shy. Like Super Shy. I never liked to talk and I hated being the center of attention. My social skills were 0/100. In fact, I won the Quietest Superlative in High School. That was how quiet I was. In Middle School, I only talked to close friends and whenever I had to. Nothing more. I remember being in my Algebra 1 class and one of my close friends, Mihir, challenged me to speak up. He asked our teacher, Mrs. Jameson, whether she thought I needed to talk more. We joked around way too much in that class. At the time, I felt frustrated and scared. But looking back, I can credit a lot of my growth and improvement in my speaking to him. He was the first to challenge me and make me want to speak out more. In high school, I improved little by little, but I really only talked when I needed to. I didn't participate in class discussions much and I stuck to close friends. In my sophomore year of high school, I took public speaking as an elective class. Oh did I suck at public speaking, but the class really helped me get out of my comfort zone each day and speak up. Even today, I use some of what I learned in that class in my interactions with other people. Now that I'm in college, I've decided to get further out of my comfort zone. For me, I think of college as a chance to push myself and seek new adventures. Being shy was a limitation I did not want in the way. However, am I a changed person? No. I am still me. :)</p>
