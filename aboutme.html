                        <p class="p1">My name is Jonathan Wang and I am currently a freshman in college. I attend Cornell University and I am majoring in Computer Science in the College of Arts and Sciences. I am interested in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Robotics, and Web Design/Development. I also have an interest in Environmental Sustainability, leaving me with a desire to utilize computer science as a means to help the world.</p>

                        <p class="p2">I am 18 years old and my birthday is on July 16, 2005. I have a twin, Christopher, and an older brother, Alex. Christopher attends the University of Massachusetts Amherst and studies Biomedical Engineering. Alex attends Cornell University and studies Computer Science. We can be a hectic bunch sometimes... :/</p>

                        <p class="p3">Outside of academics, I have picked up a couple of hobbies. They include playing video games, exploring new cuisines, working out, fashion, dancing, and listening to music. I enjoy playing Valorant with friends, eating foods from different cultures with my family, and listening to Christian pop or Lofi. My dream is to travel the world, to glance up at the Northern Lights or look around in the middle of the Colosseum. I hope I can experience and explore the glory and beauty of God's creation.</p>
